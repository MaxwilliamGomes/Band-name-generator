# Band-name-generator


##1. Creating a greeting for the program.

print("Welcome to the band name generator ")

##2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.

City = input("What city were you born in?\n ")

##3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.

Pet = input("What is your pet's name? \n")

##4. Now I'm going to combine the city and pet name and show the band name.

print("Your band can be " + City + Pet)


##Done
